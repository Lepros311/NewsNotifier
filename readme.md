# Weather Notifier

This is the second web scraper project I've done. It scrapes the local weather from Weather.com and emails it to me daily each morning. This is an Azure Functions project. It's the second time I've used Microsoft Azure and the Azure Functions portal to deploy and monitor an app. 

## Requirements

- [x] Read data from a website once a day and send it to a specific e-mail address.
- [x] You don't need any interaction with the program. It will be a service that runs automatically.
- [x] The data is collected from Weather.com.
- [x] Use the Agility Pack library for scraping.
